# godot-imposter
imposter plugin for godot 4.x

Simple implementation of octahedral impostors in Godot. 


This project was inspired by: https://github.com/wojtekpil/Godot-Octahedral-Impostors


Unfortunately, the author's last update was 2 years ago, and this project has not been adapted for the godot4 version. The godot4.x version has significant changes compared to the godot3.x version, making it incompatible with this project.
Therefore, based on this project and taking into account the features of the godot4.x version and my personal understanding of imposters, I have implemented a version suitable for godot4.1.2.

I would like to thank the original author for their work. I reused the shader code and made modifications specifically for the godot4.x version.
